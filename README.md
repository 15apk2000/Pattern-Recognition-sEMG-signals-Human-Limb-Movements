# Pattern-Recognition-sEMG-signals-Human-Limb-Movements

#In this work, an end-to-end system is proposed which
detects the intention of the user and mimics the intended
position in a robotic simulator. Our
classification model with the new proposed feature set gives
performance comparable to other feature sets commonly used
in EMG signal classification. The system model presented is
promising for practical deployments in prosthesis, rehab and
industrial purposes as well as being computationally tractable
